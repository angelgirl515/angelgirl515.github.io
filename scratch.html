                <li><b>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</b>
                <ul>While programming I learned more about the "or" and "and" tags. They have become very useful to my game <br> because it helped with simplifying the code and getting the sprites to work. </ul></li>
                <li><b>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</b>
                <ul>The problem I encounter was making the bullets move to where I needed it to go and how fast it should go. I fixed it by adding a certain <br> code to make it go where the ship was. Also, it was a trial and effct to make the bullets not go too fast nor too slow.</ul></li>
                <li><b>What aspects of your game do you like best?</b>
                <ul>My favorite aspect of the game is the design and the difficulty of it.</ul></li>
                <li><b>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</b>
                <ul>If I had more time I would like to add difficulty levels and fix the scoring system.</ul></li>
