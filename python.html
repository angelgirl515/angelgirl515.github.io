    <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ol>
                <li><b>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your story.</b>
                <ul>While creating the interactive story, there was a lot of if, else statements that were used. Without the if, else statements there will not be any seperate paths. There was also a high use in loops. With loops, it allows the player to constantly input any answer if wrong.</ul></li>
                <li><b>Think back to other stories you read, identify one or two stories you particularly like? Why?</b>
                <ul>One story that I enjoyed the most was Sanic. It was funny, and with every choice there was always a different event. Also, it was very unexpected.</ul></li>
